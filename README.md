# Overview

### Usage

Users should be able to:

- Save Links and Leads with custom names for future usages.
- Use the Saved links directly from the extension by opening them in a new browser tab.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- JavaScript

## Installation

Extract the zipped folder and go to the manage chrome extension page. Turn on developer mode, then click on the load unpacked button then select the extracted folder. Pin the extension for easy accessibility. Activate the extension by clicking on the icon.

## Continued development

This will further be developed and the up coming updates will enable users to save the current page's URL without copying and pasting it in the link input area by just clicking on a `Save Page` Button.
